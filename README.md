**Project's title**

US bike_share data statistics


**Project's description**

This project is a part of the Udacity training course on python module in the 'programming for data science' track. It is using Numpy and Pandas libraries in python to calculate some statistics about using the bike_share for trips in three cities in USA (Chicago, New York and Washington).


**Used files' types**

The used file in this project is a python script.

**project's details**
